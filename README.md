# Swoonatra

#### by Robert Bruce

## Description
This repository was made to practice scripting in Ruby. It contains two scripts:

### Usage Instructions

#### build-project.rb
This script builds you a Sinatra Ruby environment. It should be run from the terminal of a system that has a version of ruby installed. It will ask you a series of questions about your project, then create a new project directory next to the directory it is ran from. It will also initialize your repo in git and add a boilerplate Ruby .gitignore file.

#### commit_me.rb
Commit_me is an app that was made to automate the commit process for independent friday projects. Once started it will create new branches, commit to them, them attempt to merge those changes back into the current branch. Currently it does not have error handling so its possible for a merge to fail. In this case, your work will still be saved in the newly created branch.
